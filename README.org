* About
r-autoyas is a small ESS complement. It provides automatically created
yasnippets for R function argument lists.

* Requirements
The following are needed:
- yasnippet https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet
- R & ESS
- R process must be running.
* Usage
- To expand the snipped type the function name and them press =TAB=.
- To jump from field to feild press =TAB=.  If you did not change the
  field, the parameter will be deleted from this list
- To exit the snipped and delete remaining arguments, press =C-g=
* Limitations
- No nice error handling when no R process is found
- Partial nested support -- not perfected
* Loading r-autoyas in ~/.emacs
You may use marmalade-repo and ELPA to install r-autoyas
(http://marmalade-repo.org/), or put it into your load-path and put
the following in ~/.emacs
